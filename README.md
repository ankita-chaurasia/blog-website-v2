# blog-website-v2
An updated version of the blog website with a storage/non-relational DB implementation.

It has a mongoDB implementation using mongoose that is currently not hosted online, hence won't run on your machine. 
It wasn't developed to run on every machine, rather to help one understand the basics and working with a non-relational database as simply as possible.
